Author: Christopher S.
Date: 05/17/2017


TODO's:
	Sprint 1:
		-Due: 05/20/2017
		-Objectives:
			*Add concurrency to application to make runtime better
			*Sample 50 and report run time in "Current Runtime" section to show improvement
			*Try to get 50 done in under 5 minutes.
	
	Sprint 2:
		-Due: 05/26/2017
		-Objectives:
			*Fix more implementation issues and clean up code.
			*Add comments to everything to make it understandable.
			*Start add GUI interface so lay users could use this program.
				@Allow one to input an anagram word and have it solved and returned.
				@Allow a button click to begin solving all of the words in the current
				 project file directory.
	Sprint 3:
		-Due: 06/02/2017
		-Objectives:
			*Prepare documentation for users to use the software.
			*Package with Windows/Linux installer so that users can easily install.
			*Research and handle how cross platform will work.
			*Prepare with the installer an uninstaller as well to make sure this
			 software leaves no footprint on the users computer when done.


Project Goals:
	*Be able to have a on hand anagram puzzle solver for any word possible in English.
	*Be able to a generator to solve all anagram puzzles from word bank of over 325000 words.
	*Be as fast and user friendly as possible.


Current Runtime:
	*Projected Rate (Sampled at 50 items took around 10 minutes): 19hours until completion on single thread.
	*I am looking to actively add concurrency such that I would use 10 threads to do 10 calculations at once
	 to take advantage of more CPU usage.
